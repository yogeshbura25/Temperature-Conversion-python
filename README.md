# Temperature-Conversion-python
This Python program is a simple utility for converting temperature between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K) scales.
Users can input a temperature value and its scale, and the program will provide the temperature in all three scales, rounded to two decimal places.
Input the temperature value and its scale (e.g., 25C, 77F, 298K) without spaces.
The program will convert the temperature to Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
The results will be displayed in the same format as the input.
